# advjam2023
So what exactly is the vision? It's a pass the game style project. Each of us will take turns adding some features or whatever we'd like to make the game even better or more complete. We won't communicate or plan with each other about what the overall game will be like. That will be up to each one of us during our respective development periods. We will all be decision makers! 

- The game will be made for the upcoming Adventure Jam which starts in roughly 10 days. The Jam is 14 days long. 

- During the jam period we will divide out the days and time equally amongst ourselves. For example if there's 14 days and there's 5 of us. Each one of us will get about 3 days to work on the jam. 

- During your time you can work on the jam as much or as little as you'd like but it would be advisable to try to commit to a minimum amount of hours you'd like to work on it. I'd recommend 4-10 hours. The beauty of this style of project is that none of us get bogged down by the work load and we can all contribute to something fun and unique in the end.

- As far as communication we can't plan anything out with the others but we can talk about the game and our general progress on it. Keep it general.

- We can use github for collaboration, and if everyone is ok with it, I think it would be best for the project to be under the MIT license or another CC-type of license.

- For engine we'll be using Godot 4 (standard version not .net version)

- Let's keep the content of the game safe for work as well (i.e. PG/PG13) If you're unsure about something, just leave it out. We want everyone to feel comfortable.

- As far as contributions to the project. Let's keep the emphasis on adding rather than subtracting. Please always try to avoid outright deleting other people's work. Instead try to change it/add to it. 

- Because it's a pass the game style jam, I think it makes the most sense for us all to use already made art/music. Of course if you want to make and add something to it during your time feel free to, but that is the reason we won't be having an artist/musician for this project.

- Contributions should also strive to be complete. Please don't make a lot of unfinished additions to the game. This puts the pressure on others to try to tie up lots of loose ends instead of adding something fresh to the game. Of course you may run out of time and leave some things unfinished. That's ok. 

- And of course the most important thing: go with the flow and have fun. Let's see where the project goes and don't be offended if something you added ends up looking much different than the finished product! That's a part of the fun.
